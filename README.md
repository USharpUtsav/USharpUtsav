# Hi, I'm Utsav 👋

DevSecOps Engineer working at the intersection of Cloud Infrastructure and AI Systems.

I enjoy building secure, production-ready environments where machine learning models and intelligent systems can actually run reliably.

## Interests

- Machine Learning Systems
- Cloud Model Hosting
- AI Infrastructure
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM Deployment Architectures
- Emerging architectures (DeepSeek-style thinking & Kimi direction)

Currently exploring how modern AI models move from research → real-world deployment.
